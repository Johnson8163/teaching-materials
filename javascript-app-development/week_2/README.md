# Week 2 Code Samples

Use these examples to follow along with the lecture slides. To run each challenge, open a command prompt and run the following command (use the path on your machine and change the file name to whichever one you are trying to run):

`node path/to/challenge.js`

## 2.1 Functions: Part 1

Challenges 2 and 4 are the harder ones- we will try to work these together in class. You may want extra practice on ES6 Rest Parameters; there are some exercises [here](http://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/template-strings/basics) that you may want to do.

## 2.2 Functions: Part 2

Challenge 4 is not discussed in the lecture slides- it's meant as a practice excercise for working with callbacks and array functions. Feel free to do it as homework.
