# Week 2 Code Samples

Use these examples to follow along with the lecture slides. To run each challenge, open a command prompt and run the following command (use the path on your machine and change the file name to whichever one you are trying to run):

`node path/to/challenge.js`

Note for the ES6Kata TDD Practice: You cannot save your work on these, so if you want to save your answers, I recommend copying them to a file on your machine and keeping a folder of solved exercises.

## 2.1 Functions: Part 1

Challenges 2 and 4 are the harder ones- we will try to work these together in class. You may want extra practice on ES6 Rest Parameters; there are some exercises [here](http://tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/rest/as-parameter) that you may want to do.

## 2.2 Functions: Part 2

Challenge 4 is not discussed in the lecture slides- it's meant as a practice excercise for working with callbacks and array functions. Feel free to do it as homework. There are some additional exercises [here](http://tddbin.com/?#?kata=es6/language/arrow-functions/basics) for arrow functions.
