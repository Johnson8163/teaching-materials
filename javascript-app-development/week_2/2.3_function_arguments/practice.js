// Let's try some more practice
// Using the practice problem you solved before, make the calculateSum function work for any array of integers
// You may still assume that the array will always be an array of integers.

const calculateSum = function () {
    //Your code here
}

const sum = calculateSum();

console.log(`The sum is: ${sum}`);
