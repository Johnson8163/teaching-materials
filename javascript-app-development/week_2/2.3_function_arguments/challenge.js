// Okay now for a challenge

// Let's say we have a group of students and we want to represent
// a single student with a JSON object such as the following:

// {
//     "name": "Dan",
//     "age": 36,
//     "isCool": true,
//     "heightInInches": 68
// }

// Work in groups of two or three (depending on class size) take 15-20 minutes to write a program that will output:
// * The longest name of any one student
// * The average age of all students
// * the average height of cool students
// * the average height of non-cool students

// You may format the output however you like, however your solution must be broken into functions.
// You should also test your code using a reasonably sized set of test data

// When you have finished:
// Discuss with each other the best way to organize your code/functions so that it is as READABLE as possible
// Discuss other possible ways you could have implemented your solution and try to
// consider the drawbacks of your implementation versus the others you came up with
