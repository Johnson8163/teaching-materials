// Let's try some practice
// Using what you learned about control flow last week,
// Try to write a function that will calculate and RETURN the sum of the elements of an array.
// You should call this function to get the sum and then display it in the console.

// Example: if you use the array [5, 10, 12, 17, 2], your function should return the value 46
// For this practice problem, you may assume that the array will always contain only integer numbers.

const calculateSum = function () {
    //Your code here
}

const sum = calculateSum();

console.log(`The sum is: ${sum}`);
