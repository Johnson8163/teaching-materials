// Filters
    // Write a function called myFilter that takes two parameters: an array, and a callback function.
    // myFilter should pass each element of the array to the callback and if the callback function 
    // returns true, it should add that element to a result array.
    // Next, write filter functions that can filter on different values:
        // write one to return only even numbers
        // write one for odd numbers
        // write one for numbers that are divisible by 5
        // write one for numbers that contain a '0'
