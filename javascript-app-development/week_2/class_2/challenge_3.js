        // Try to take your solution from the palindrome problem in week_1 > class_2
        // and make a dedicated function for it here. Then, in a separate file,
        // import that function and call it.

        // Then, create a separate JSON file for your data. It should contain
        // a single JSON object with a "strings" property which holds an array
        // of strings you want to test. Use this array to define as many strings
        // as you want to test. Alter your main code to call the library function
        // for every item in your array and print out the results.
