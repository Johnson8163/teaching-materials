# Week 1 Code Samples

Use these examples to follow along with the lecture slides. To run each challenge, open a command prompt and run the following command (use the path on your machine and change the file name to whichever one you are trying to run):

`node path/to/challenge.js`

## 1.1 Introduction and Syntax
