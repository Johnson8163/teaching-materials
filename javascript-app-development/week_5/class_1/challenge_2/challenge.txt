Part 1:

    Create a Form and add validations using jQuery
    Utilize the html and css provided
    Create a function that will fire when the submit <button> is clicked
    Make sure the function loaded after the DOM

Part 2:

    create variables for each of the form inputs
        use jQuery to accomplish this task
        (think about querySelector)
    create an array named required
        store the variables you've name, email, and phone number
    Utilize a for loop to iterate of the entire required array
    Inside the for loop:
        Use an if statement to check the value of each array item
        If the array item is equal to an empty string ("")
        Populate the message <p> with the following text: "Please Fill Out Required Fields"
        Add the warning class to this message
        Attach the warning class to the array item's <label> note: You want the label to turn red, if the field is empty
        Once the field has something other than a blank string. make sure the warning class is removed
    Close out the for loopâ€‹
    utilize another if statement
        verify that no <label>'s have the warning class
        if true
            remove the form from the DOM
            manipulate the <h2> to say: "Thanks for your feedback!"
    close out your function
    test it out!
