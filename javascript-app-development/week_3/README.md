# Week 3 Code Samples

Use these examples to follow along with the lecture slides. To run each challenge, open a command prompt and run the following command (use the path on your machine and change the file name to whichever one you are trying to run):

`node path/to/challenge.js`

Note for the ES6Kata TDD Practice: You cannot save your work on these, so if you want to save your answers, I recommend copying them to a file on your machine and keeping a folder of solved exercises.

## 3.1 Object Orientation

I highly recommend practicing ES6 class structures using [these](tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/class/creation) exercises (numbers 22-28) after class, along with [this](tddbin.com/#?kata=es6/language/modules/import) exercise on modules.

## 3.2 JavaScript in the Browser, DOM, and Debugging

The exercises for this class involve using the debugging tools in the browser. You will need to open the html file for each challenge in your browser (view the files in finder, right click -> Open With -> Google Chrome). From there, you can use the dev tools in Chrome and make any necessary changes to the .js file in the challenge folder. You should see your changes when you refresh the page. You may be required to write a small amount of HTML for one or more of the challenges.
