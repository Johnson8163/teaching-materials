# Week 8 Code Samples

Use this example to follow along with the lecture slides.

## 8.1: Redux

This example contains a working implementation of redux. Use it to follow through the slides, paying special attention to the pattern of using actions, reducers, and store. Once you understand the pattern, apply it to your mini project from Week 6-7.

## 8.2 AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This class focuses on deploying an application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Using the redux app you created in the last class, add the necessary build files to deploy it to Elastic Beanstalk and access your app via the internet.
