# Week 9 Code Samples

Use this example to follow along with the lecture slides.

## 9.1: Databases

Until now, our data within the app has not been persistent. Using Elastic Beanstalk, create a new environment with a Database. Initialize that database with a table called notes. The two directories here are an example Node API for accessing a postgres database in elastic beanstalk and an accompanying react app.

## 9.2, 10.1, 10.2: Portfolio Projects

For the rest of the class, work on a personal portfolio project to showcase as many skills as you can. This can be a personal website, some kind of app you want to build, etc. Be as creative as you can and show off as many of your skills as you can. Push all of your code to github and deploy your project to AWS so that it is available to the internet. Don't forget to document your project in github (with a README) and make sure your code is as clean as possible.
